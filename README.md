====================

[IsFlashInstalled](https://gamediamond3757.github.io/isflashinstalled.com/build/website.html) will tell you if Adobe Flash is installed and, if so, what version.

## How does it work?

This site uses three methods to detect the presence of Macromedia/Adobe Flash: JavaScript Flash Detection Library (Flash Detect) (Version 1.0.4), Adobe Flash Player Detection Kit (Revision 1.5) Client-Side Detection (with some customization), and Adobe Flash Player Detection Kit (Revision 1.5) Server-Side Detection (PHP). The PHP script is somewhat unreliable, so it is only used if JavaScript is unavailable.

## Who made this?
[David Newton](http://davidnewton.ca/) made the site. The [JavaScript Flash Detection Library (Flash Detect)](http://www.featureblend.com/javascript-flash-detection-library.html) is part of the [JavaScript Flash Foundation Series](http://www.featureblend.com/#javascript-flash-foundation-series) by the [JavaScript Flash Foundation Series Group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/javascript-flash-foundation-series), copyright Â© 2007 Carl S. Yestrau; the [Flash Player Detection Kit](http://solutionpartners.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/download/detection_kit/) is by [Adobe](http://adobe.com/).

## Is the code available?
Yes. [The code for the site is available on GitHub](http://github.com/nwtn/isflashinstalled.com/), under an [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Fork it, clone it, fix it, etc.
